       " 'copyright   2020, quiller media, inc.  contact us   privacy policy   advertise on ai investment bank wedbush has raised its aapl price target to $425 and claims that apple could hit a $2 trillion price valuation in 2021.  in an investors  note seen by appleinsider, lead analyst daniel ives writes that apple has  lots of gas left in the tank.  this fuel is primarily the 5g equipped  iphone 12  launch just over the horizon, says ives.  ives adds that tailwinds from the 5g rollout and apple s strong services momentum could be key ingredients to the cupertino tech giant s further growth. the u.s. variants of 2020 s iphones are expected to support mmwave 5g, since apple has  ironed out  some wrinkles in the tech.  the analyst says that the  iphone 12  lineup is likely to debut in the mid to late september timeframe, but he isn t clear on when he thinks the phones will actually ship. furthermore, ives believes that some models could launch in the sub $1,000 price range despite additional 5g components.  apple could also create more cross sell opportunity for airpods, since recent wedbush supply chain checks corroborate rumors that the  iphone 12  won t come with wired earpods in the box. apple is currently on a trajectory to ship 85 million airpod units in 2019, he said.  on services, wedbush has assigned a $600 to $650 billion valuation range given its increasing importance as a revenue stream and its appreciation by investors during coronavirus.  ives maintains that the fall iphone lineup will drive a  5g super cycle  for apple, based on estimates that 350 million of apple s 950 million strong iphone user base is in an upgrade window. pent up demand in china will also be a key factor, since wedbush forecasts that 20% of all upgrades will come out of the country in the next few years.  wedbush asia and supply chain checks have led to a 160 million to 180 million iphone unit estimate in 2020 with  strong underlying momentum  heading into 2021.  the analyst s 12 month $425 price target is based on a sum of the parts valuation estimate for 2021. wedbush arrived at that number from a 9.8x multiple to services at $600 billion and a 5.5x multiple for hardware at $1.3 trillion.  this is the second time in june that ives has bumped up his aapl price target. earlier in june, he raised it to $375, from $350, on rock solid services performance and the aforementioned super cycle.  shares of aapl are currently trading at $359.41, down 0.18% since markets opened thursday. apple s stock price is up 2.4% since june 22, when it announced a slate of new software updates, like ios 14, and a broad transition to apple silicon in macs at wwdc 2020.  appleinsider has affiliate partnerships and may earn commission on products purchased through affiliate links.          these partnerships do not influence our editorial content.      quote apple is currently on a trajectory to ship 85 million airpod units in 2019, he said.2019? 2020 is more than half over already. perhaps some wires have gotten crossed a bit?there is more to the valuation of a company than the sum of its stock price multiplied by the number of outstandinf shares. you have to take into consideration a lot of other factors especially the gearing and for a company that actually sells physical things, the amount of money that potential customers have to spend when there is a huge recession looming around the world.  now where is that big pinch of salt?   cook s us antitrust hearing appearance rescheduled for july 29 apple releases trailer for season 2 of  for all mankind  how apple a series chips stack up against intel macs instagram claims bug triggered ios 14 camera notifications when not in use how to pick the best monitor for studying and working from home ultimate 16 inch macbook pro deal roundup  up to $600 off, plus applecare discount   5% back apple employees granted paid time off to vote in us election epic games ceo criticizes apple s app store policies in interview']"
